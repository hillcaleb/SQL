# Data Analysis Project using SQL
> This project is for a fake movie rental company: Rockbuster Stealth LLC
>
> Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.

# Overview
In your capacity as a data analyst at Rockbuster Stealth, you're responsible for two main tasks. The first is to set up a relational database management system (RDBMS) and import all of Rockbuster's data into it. This lays the groundwork for data analysis. Secondly, use SQL to examine the data and address ad-hoc business queries from various departments, contributing to data-driven decision-making and the effective launch of the new online video service.

## Key Questions for the Analysis

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
